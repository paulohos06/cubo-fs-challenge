This project was made for applying to a position as Software Engineer at [Cubo Network](https://github.com/cubonetwork/fullstack-challenge). It was developed using JavaScript and MongoDB. It was divided in front-end (client) made with Vue Framework and back-end (server) made with NodeJS + Express. The client communicates with server through REST API in order to get users data.

## Last Thoughts

I actually used this project as a study, in building a full javascript application from the ground up. A few things could be improved, and could've been done differently, but the main goal is to use the feedback to improve it even further.
Thanks for the opportunity!
